experment with depth (number of layer)

model 1:
build models with one hidden layer and train and find the find the validation accuracy 
(128)

model 2:
build a model with 3 hidden layers and find the validation accuracy 
(1024.512,256)

model 3:
build a model with 5 hidden layers and fine the validation accuracy
(1024.512,256,128,64) 

plot the validation accuracy for all 3 models in a single plot 
plot the validation loss for all 3 models 


experment with optimizers 

model 1:
build models with one SGD optimizers and train and find the find the validation accuracy 

model 2:
build a model with ADAM and find the validation accuracy 


model 3:
build a model with RMSprop and fine the validation accuracy

plot the validation accuracy for all 3 models in a single plot 
plot the validation loss for all 3 models 

Note : use different model name for each model.
